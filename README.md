In this project you will build a YouTube video page. The main goal is to make the media elements to show up and not to make an exact replica of the page. In other words you need to focus on two main things. First to embed the YouTube video player into the page so it is actually plays and second to show little thumbnails images along the right side.

In regards to styling it is up to you. Feel free to experiment as you like.

Don’t worry about other elements on the YouTube page that has to do with dynamic elements. Those elements are wired up using JavaScript. For example don’t worry about the "Show more" link below the description which dynamically expands to show more. In addition don’t worry to make the comment form work properly.


Create a blank HTML document.

Come up with a plan — which sections of the page should be grouped together (e.g. the navigation bar vs the video vs the sidebar etc)?

Create empty semantic HTML elements to enclose those sections.

Use basic CSS to size and position them appropriately on the page. A useful tip is to make their backgrounds different colors so you can see the different sections. Don’t forget to use your browser’s developer tools (right click on the page, click "inspect element")!

Fill in those divs with content by creating the navbar.

Embed a YouTube video of your choice into your page.

Build the sidebar section where previews of suggested videos show up. Just grab some thumbnail-sized images and plug them in. Obviously don’t worry about generating those previews.

Finish up by filling in some of the elements below the video — the title, description and number of views. Once more ignore the icons (many of them are produced using sprites or more advanced techniques so you won’t be able to just grab them by copying them).

Push your solution up to a private Github repo, add your instructor(s) as collaborator(s) and submit the URL in the Quiz below.
